# Student Notes
If you have any bonus specs, bonus or any details the TA's should know, you should include it here:
-
For the bonus specs, we decided to do a mix of UI changes as well as actual gameplay changes. Firstly, related to actual gameplay changes, we changed how the PlayerCreature moves. The creature now moves like the sine function, making it more challenging
for the player to score more points and grab the PowerUp since coordination is needed. As for the UI changes, we added a pause feature so the player can catch a breath after an intense gaming session, in the aquarium of course. This is accessed by pressing the p key. While playing, if the player is a newbie, they can press the h key in order to get some general instructions on how the game works, but not much detail since we have to make it hard somehow. Furthermore, after a certain time has passed, a minute to be exact, the music changes from a calming, under the water music to an intense music so the player feels the pressure and makes it more challenging to stay focused. Lastly, we decided to add a new fish species, apart from the two specified, to be used in the new levels, the new creature being the Shark creature. This one moves fast, then slow, then fast. That's all for this bonus sections, thanks!
